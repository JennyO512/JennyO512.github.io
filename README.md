# BMI ME TO THE MOON ðŸš€

##### Video Demo:  [BMI Me To The Moon Video Demo](https://youtu.be/b7Xhd3dDS28).
### Description
***BMI Me To The Moon*** ðŸš€  is my final project for CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python.  ***BMI Me To The Moon*** ðŸš€ will calcuate the BMI of a user here on Earth and then produce the calculation of their weight (in pounds) On The Moon. To begin you will need to install the emoji library using the pip install emoji in your terminal window.
Then you will need to enter python project.py which will prompt the user for their weight in pounds.  Then the user will be prompted to enter their height.  The program has functions being called that will automatically calculate the BMI and/or pounds.  [Emojis](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/) can be found here.  There are alot of different ones to use.  It is as simple as copying an emoji that you like and then pasting it into your code. 

### Files and functions

   - pip install emoji to import a dictionary of Emoji Codes as defined by Unicode contortium.

##### project.py
 - Obtains users input via the def main() float input function.
- Custom function def convert_height calculates the inputted height and returns that number in a variable named h2.
- Custom function calcuate_weight stores the inputted weight in a variable called w.
- Custom function cal_bmi would round the BMI however i am not using this function in the program.

##### test_project.py
 - Contains functions for use with pytest.
 - test_convertheight tests for a number that is not 0 and is not a negative integer.
 - test_calcuate_weight tests that inputted number is not an alphacharacter.
